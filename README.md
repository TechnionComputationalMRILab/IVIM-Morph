## IVIM-Morph Repository: 

This repository contains two works for quantitative DWI analysis for fetal lung MRI.

## 1. EECV: code for the paper "qDWI-Morph: Motion-compensated quantitative Diffusion-Weighted MRI analysis for fetal lung maturity assessment" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.09836.pdf

## 2. IVIM-Morph : self-supervised deep neural network model for motion-corrected quantitative analysis of DWI data using the Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) model.
