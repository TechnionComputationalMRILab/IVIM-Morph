## IVIM-Morph Repository: 

This repository contains two works for quantitative DWI analysis for fetal lung MRI.

### 1. ECCV:
Code for the paper "qDWI-Morph: Motion-compensated quantitative Diffusion-Weighted MRI analysis for fetal lung maturity assessment"
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.09836.pdf

### 2. IVIM-Morph:
Self-supervised deep neural network model for motion-corrected quantitative analysis of DWI data using the Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) model.
Code for the paper: "IVIM-Morph: Motion-compensated quantitative Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) analysis for functional fetal lung maturity assessment from diffusion-weighted MRI data"
